# This translates a utf-8-encoded byte into how many bytes the full utf8
# character occupies.  Illegal start bytes have a negative count.

# UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding.  The 128 ASCII characters were very
# deliberately set to be themselves, so UTF-8 would be backwards compatible
# with 7-bit applications.  Every other character has 2 - 13 bytes comprising
# it.
#
# If the first bit of the first byte in a character is 0, it is one of those
# 128 ASCII characters with length 1.

# Otherwise, the first bit is 1, and if the second bit is also one, this byte
# starts the sequence of bytes that represent the character.  The bytes C0-FF
# have the characteristic that the first two bits are both one.  The number of
# bytes that form a character corresponds to the number of consecutive leading
# bits that are all one in the start byte.  In the case of FE, the first 7
# bits are one, so the number of bytes in the character it represents is 7.
# FF is a special case, and Perl has arbitrarily set it to 13 instead of the
# expected 8.
#
# The remaining bytes begin with '10', from 80..9F.  They are called
# continuation bytes, and a UTF-8 character is comprised of a start byte
# indicating 'n' bytes total in it, then 'n-1' of these continuation bytes.
# What the character is that each sequence represents is derived by shifting
# and adding the other bits in the bytes.  (C0 and C1 aren't actually legal
# start bytes for security reasons that need not concern us here, hence are
# marked as negative in the table below.)

Encode::ZapCP1252 - Zap Windows Western Gremlins

=head1 Synopsis

  use Encode::ZapCP1252;

  # Zap or fix in-place.
  zap_cp1252 $latin1_text;
  fix_cp1252 $utf8_text;

  # Zap or fix copy.
  my $clean_latin1 = zap_cp1252 $latin1_text;
  my $fixed_utf8   = fix_cp1252 $utf8_text;

=head1 Description

Have you ever been processing a Web form submit for feed, assuming that the
incoming text was encoded as specified in the Content-Type header, or in the
XML declaration, only to end up with a bunch of junk because someone pasted in
content from Microsoft Word? Well, this is because Microsoft uses a superset
of the Latin-1 encoding called "Windows Western" or "CP1252". If the specified
encoding is Latin-1, mostly things will come out right, but a few things--like
curly quotes, m-dashes, ellipses, and the like--may not. The differences are
well-known; you see a nice chart at documenting the differences on
L<Wikipedia|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252>.

Of course, that won't really help you. What will help you is to quit using
Latin-1 and switch to UTF-8. Then you can just convert from CP1252 to UTF-8
without losing a thing, just like this:

  use Encode;
  $text = decode 'cp1252', $text, 1;

But I know that there are those of you out there stuck with Latin-1 and who
don't want any junk characters from Word users. That's where this module comes
in. Its C<zap_cp1252> function will zap those CP1252 gremlins for you, turning
them into their appropriate ASCII approximations.

Another case that can occasionally come up is when you're reading reading in
text that I<claims> to be UTF-8, but it I<still> ends up with some CP1252
gremlins mixed in with properly encoded characters. I've seen examples of just
this sort of thing when processing GMail messages and attempting to insert
them into a UTF-8 database, as well as in some feeds processed by, say
Yahoo! Pipes. Doesn't work so well. For such cases, there's C<fix_cp1252>,
which converts those CP1252 gremlins into their UTF-8 equivalents.

=head1 Usage

This module exports two subroutines: C<zap_cp1252()> and C<fix_cp1252()>,
each of which accept a single argument:

  zap_cp1252 $text;
  fix_cp1252 $text;

When called in a void context, as in these examples, C<zap_cp1252()> and
C<fix_cp1252()> subroutine perform I<in place> conversions of any CP1252
gremlins into their appropriate ASCII approximations or UTF-8 equivalents,
respectively. Note that because the conversion happens in place, the data to
be converted I<cannot> be a string constant; it must be a scalar variable.

When called in a scalar or list context, on the other hand, a copy will be
modifed and returned. The original string will be unchanged:

  my $clean_latin1 = zap_cp1252 $latin1_text;
  my $fixed_utf8   = fix_cp1252 $utf8_text;

In this case, even constant values can be processed. Either way, C<undef>s
will be ignored.

In Perl 5.8.8 and higher, the conversion will work even when the string is
decoded to Perl's internal form (usually via C<decode 'ISO-8859-1', $text>) or
the string is encoded (and thus simply processed by Perl as a series of
bytes). The conversion will even work on a string that has not been decoded
but has had its C<utf8> flag flipped anyway (usually by an injudicious use of
C<Encode::_utf8_on()>. This is to enable the highest possible likelihood of
removing those CP1252 gremlins no matter what kind of processing has already
been executed on the string.

In Perl 5.10 and higher, the functions may optionally be called with no
arguments, in which case C<$_> will be converted, instead:

  zap_cp1252; # Modify $_ in-place.
  fix_cp1252; # Modify $_ in-place.
  my $zapped = zap_cp1252; # Copy $_ and return zapped
  my $fixed = zap_cp1252; # Copy $_ and return fixed

=head1 Conversion Table

Here's how the characters are converted to ASCII and UTF-8. The ASCII
conversions are not perfect, but they should be good enough for general
cleanup. If you want perfect, switch to UTF-8 and be done with it!

=head2 Changing the Tables

Don't like these conversions? You can modify them to your heart's content by
accessing this module's internal conversion tables. For example, if you wanted
C<zap_cp1252()> to use an uppercase "E" for the euro sign, just do this:

  local $Encode::ZapCP1252::ascii_for{"\x80"} = 'E';

Or if, for some bizarre reason, you wanted the UTF-8 equivalent for a bullet
converted by C<fix_cp1252()> to really be an asterisk (why would you? Just use
C<zap_cp1252> for that!), you can do this:

  local $Encode::ZapCP1252::utf8_for{"\x95"} = '*';

Just remember, without C<local> this would be a global change. In that case,
be careful if your code zaps CP1252 elsewhere. Of course, it shouldn't really
be doing that. These functions are just for cleaning up messes in one spot in
your code, not for making a fundamental part of your text handling. For that,
use L<Encode>.
